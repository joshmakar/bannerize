# Illustrator Grommetize (V1.0)

An Adobe Illustrator script that is used for generating grommet location marks for banners.

## Installation

To install, extract the grommetize.jsx to the scripts folder for Adobe Illustrator.  
Ex: C:/Program Files(x86)/Adobe/[Adobe Illustrator Folder]/Presets/en_US/Scripts

## Usage

Set your art board to the banner size and run the script.

## History

v1.0:
>- Initial repository setup.

## To-do

Polish coding.

## Issues

Somewhat fixed issue concerning artboard resize. Grommets are correctly laid out, just not in the right location.

~Resizing artboards after document has created causes issues. Script will run as if the artboard was still the same size as it was when initially created.~
